Resolution - The ticket is resolved when the issue or request has been resolved to the satisfaction of the requester.
Closure - The ticket is closed once it has been resolved and the requester has confirmed that the issue or request has been resolved to their satisfaction.
Follow-up - In some cases, the support team may follow up with the requester after the ticket has been closed to ensure that the issue or request has not resurfaced.
