<p>
  <ul>Working the Issue in progress</ul> - The assigned agent begins working on the ticket by gathering information, troubleshooting, and communicating with the requester.Pending: If the ticket requires further information or clarification, it may be placed in a pending status until the requester provides the necessary details.
On-hold: If the ticket cannot be resolved immediately or requires action from an external party, it may be placed on hold until the issue can be resolved.
Escalation - If the ticket is not resolved within a certain timeframe or requires further attention, it may be escalated to a higher level of support or management.
